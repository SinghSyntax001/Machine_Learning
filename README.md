## **ðŸ”¹ About This Repository**
This repository contains implementations of various **Machine Learning (ML) models**, which I am learning and practicing. The goal is to build a structured collection of ML algorithms, covering different techniques and applications.

## **ðŸ“‚ Current Progress**
âœ… **Regression Models**  
- Implementation of fundamental regression techniques  
- Includes code, explanations, and real-world use cases  

âœ… **Classification Models**  
- Implementation of basic and advanced classification algorithms  
- Supports both binary and multiclass classification  
- Integrated evaluation metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, **ROC-AUC**  
- Visual tools: Confusion matrix, decision boundary plots (where applicable)

## **ðŸ“… Future Additions**
ðŸ”¹ Clustering algorithms  
ðŸ”¹ Dimensionality reduction  
ðŸ”¹ Neural networks and deep learning

## **ðŸš€ Usage**
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SinghSyntax001/Machine_Learning.git
   cd Machine_Learning


## Note: This toolkit will only work on the dataset where features are in first columns and dependent variables in the last, to let it work on vice-versa dataset you have to apply some datapreprocessing or one-hot encoding techniques.
