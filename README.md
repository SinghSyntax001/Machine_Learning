## **ðŸ”¹ About This Repository**
This repository contains implementations of various **Machine Learning (ML) models**, which I am learning and practicing. The goal is to build a structured collection of ML algorithms, covering different techniques and applications.  

## **ðŸ“‚ Current Progress**
âœ… **Regression Models**  
- Implementation of fundamental regression techniques.  
- Code, explanations, and use cases included.  

## **ðŸ“… Future Additions**
ðŸ”¹ Classification models  
ðŸ”¹ Clustering algorithms  
ðŸ”¹ Dimensionality reduction  
ðŸ”¹ Neural networks and deep learning  

## **ðŸš€ Usage**
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SinghSyntax001/Machine_Learning.git
